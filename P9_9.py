#Implement a class ComboLock that works like the combination lock in a gym locker, as shown here. 
# The lock is constructed with a combinationâ€”three numbers between 0 and 39. The reset method resets the dial so that it points to 0. 
# The turnLeft and turnRight methods turn the dial by a given number of ticks to the left or right. 
# The open method attempts to open the lock. The lock opens if the user first turned it right 
# to the first number in the combination, then left to the second, and then right to the third.
